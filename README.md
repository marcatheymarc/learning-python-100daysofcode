# learning-python-100daysofcode
Here's the projects I've been making in the #100daysofcode challenge! I'm taking the class taught by Dr. Angela on Udemy

#########################################

**Day 1**
we did a simple band name generator that concatenated the input of user's "City" and "Pet Animal" into a _Band Name_ lol (e.g. Montreal Dogs)
It was pretty fun, learned the simple idea behind getting "input" and "printing" things to the terminal. I unfortunately didn't think to save the file itself but the concept     behind it was simple enough that I shouldn't have to worry about reproducing it.

**Day 2**
Learning is getting me nice and motivated! Today the ending challenge was to compose a tip calculator which would take into account the following variables"
- How much did the total bill come up to
- How much (%) tip do you want to give
- How many people are splitting the total bill

I uploaded the file as tip-calculator.py on my github profile (and am writing this!) in hopes of getting more comfortable with the community's tools. Check out the line of code for the tip calculator should you wish to use it for yourself :D <3 It's obviously far from perfect but it's a start to real world application that I'm excited for.

**Day 3**
The day didn't go as well (coding wise) as I would've liked. The class took me much longer than I had anticipated; But I pushed through on every single item and found the answer myself without looking through the teacher's solution. THAT BEING SAID! The reason it didn't go as well as I would've like is because it was a Saturday, and also the birthday of my sister in-law; And since my fiancee's parents are leaving for the winter, and her birthday is in December, we also celebrated her.

We went to a wonderful Italian place called Cafe Il Cortile in Montreal. I had never been to a proper Italian place before and truly enjoyed every minute of the almost 4 hours we sat there chatting and eating. Life in Italy looks pretty darn swell and we left feeling full, recharged and socially high. Coming home after that was wonderful although we now had quite a few tasks to go over (dinner and walking the dogs amongst others). I ended up starting the class around 6PM and stopped before the Day's final project around 10:30PM - Brain was fried and I thought it would be better to pause, recharge and come back at it in the morning.

#########################################

**Day 4**
On the morning of day 4, I was motivated anew! Ready to tackle on the previous day's project as well as completing the Day 4 curriculum. I completed the Day 3 project, a simple "Choose your own adventure" kind of game (there were only 3 steps though so nothing intricate). It made for a good refresher on what I had tried to cram into my fried brain yesterday; I was able to use all the if/elif/else statements correctly, my final code didn't return any errors and I felt delighted to move onto the next thing!

as far as the remainder of the day went; I once again felt quite challenged. The day's subject was **radomisation** - I learned to "import random" and to use a few different functions from it, the end of the day project consisted in a "Rock Paper Scissors" project which I struggled with. I was able to come up with a solution, but after watching the teacher's example, I realized how inelegant and overly mapped my code was. I was still able to get a successful result, but it did feel as though I missed out on some key concepts; or at least misunderstood them.

My confidence isn't shaken though! Feeling stupid (although stupid might be a bit harsh; maybe just less apt?) is part of learning; and I know that as I progress, some things will come to naturally make more sense. And should anything require revision, I'll definitely go back through the modules to better grasp their concepts. I'll see how Day 5 goes, based on that, I might go back to day 4 for a complete redo and resume from there.

#########################################

**Day 5**
Today I'm learning about Python Loops! The end of the day project will be a random password generator - which is pretty neat! I use some every now and then for more secure PWs, so having one I can use of my own will be pretty sweet!

Ok so today was THE BEST DAY - The theme of the day was "Loops", pretty much only around the "for" function and the "range" funtion. The day's exercises all went very well; and I was able to grasp the concepts much better than yesterday. Not only that, but at the end of the day's curriculum, the teacher also explained how "feeling inadequate" in everything so far is still ok; there's a lot of concepts that will simply become clearer with time as long as I STICK TO IT YO! **_And I intend to_**.

The first exercise was simple enough and was a practice in using the basic "for" function. The objective was to calculate the average weight of a group of students; And although there are more direct functions to do so, the idea behind the practise was to understand the core logic of how loops work. I started by creating a variable for totalHeight and a variable for numberofParticipants and set them to 0; and for every 'student' in 'student_heights'(input requested), totalHeight += student; and for the participants, the loops was: for number in student_heights (previous input) numberofParticipants += 1.

This way, after getting all weight inputs, the system adds them up and counts (by +1) how many 'times' a weight was entered. To obtain the final result, I decided to store it in a variable called avgHeight = round(totalHeight / numberofParticipants) and then simply printed that variable! I used the round function to round to the nearest integer instead of giving decimals.

Now I'm all excited for tomorrow! Very happy with something though:
- Yesterday, I was on Day 4 of 100; and 100/4=25 so I was 1/25th of the way through
- Today, on Day 5 of 100; 100/5=20 so, I'm now 1/20th of the way done!
Repeating this 5 days only 19 more times will be an absolute treat! Can't wait :D

#########################################

**Day 6**
It was an interesting day! And happily, although I did feel challenged; I ended up doing very well on most exercises. We used the reeborg website to do a few simple loops and make the robot either follow a defined path; or define specs that would allow the robot to make its way to a designated target area. It all went super well up until the final exercise; that exercise being "Getting Reeborg out of a Maze". The solution I had worked alright; but required about 30% more code than the teacher's one. Breaking down the conditions was exhausting and I ended up writing about 6-7 different ones; when the suggested result had about 3.

I'm leaning towards wanting to improve my critical thinking alongside the class. Not sure where I'll find resources but I'm certain a quick search will find a few things to help me get started. I didn't save the code for Reeborg given that it was all integrated in the platform; And the standalone code would be quite useless without the application.

**Day 7**
Well hot damn! Completing Day 7 was quite satisfying, I'm officially one week into this and love it. I feel challenged, but am still glad I've been able to do full days back to back instead of splitting some over 2.

I feel as though the class I took isn't exactly advertising itself fully truly. The curriculum suggests you can "Complete a day within 2 hours"; but if you have to think about the solutions, are uncertain how some things work, need to search online to find some answers - I've found most days to take me around 3 hours, sometimes more. I'm glad I get to work from home, as this would otherwise be quite challenging. There's also a few times where the instructor mentions "in case you don't understand this concept very well yet, go back to a previous lecture"; without actually specifying which lecture would be beneficial in that particular case.

Feeling as though I'll have to redo the beginner part in order to have a more concrete understanding of it all. I've also been thinking about finding a mentor for this; I'll have to scour a few different places and ask around if anyone would be willing to help me on my coding journey.

We made a Hangman game, which was pretty fun! and I was happy to see that sometimes, my little tired brain wakes up and finds the right answers! The final errors in my code were due to a few incorrect indents; once I had changed those; everything worked out perfectly. I did want save the code, but it relied on 2 files created by the teacher and this was all done in replit; so it wouldn't be possible to load the modules on a standalone coding device, unless remade.

On a more fun side! I've been a lot on r/unixporn (in case you read this and aren't in tech, this refers to good looking computer interfaces, nothing to do with actual porn) and feel quite motivated to at least set up a VM and see how I can get acquainted with customization. From a lot of the posts I saw, Arch seems to be the way to go so, I guess we'll see what's what!

**Day 8**
Weeeeeeeeee

![diving_in](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91683428/136390345-57cb92ea-ba57-42b0-9757-8c49bb918722.gif)

Some days, that's what it feels like! But hey he who doesn't dive in head first will never learn; albeit sometimes painfully! Wracking my brain and working everything out has been great so far, and I'm glad I'm feeling very motivated. Today, tackling Day 8! Getting joyously close to Day 10, which will signify I'll be 10% of the way through! Hopefully I still feel comfortable enough to do each day in sequence, but I'm ok knowing I might need to go back from the start and revise a few key things.

In any case, should be fun! I'll update this log once I've done the course.

Aaaalrighty! So, obviously had to have a very busy day and didn't completely finish the Day 8 Module on Day 8, but I did complete it early in the morning of Day 9. I was pretty happy with having that little rest, it made solving the problem that much simpler somehow... Like the information had to "sink in" overnight.

The day's project was a Caesar Cipher! In case you don't know what that is, it's like the little cylinder in The Da Vinci Code with all letters of the alphabet, and you shift them to encrypt a message. Here's the link to the final project; Enjoy!

I started Day 9, I'll open the entry below to track the progress.

**Day 9** Dictionnaries and Nesting

Today we made a secret auction program; Wasn't the most fun of them but I can appreciate the necessity of it. The class helped me understand the use of dictionaries and their indexes/ how to return an output based on values. The principle is rather simple, dictionaries are defined by squiggly brackets {} and within any given dictionary is a key and a value defined as follows:

my_dictionary = {
  <"Key": Value,>
}

dictionaries can start off blank and be filled in based on user inputs. I'll have to revise this section to feel more at ease with it.

**Day 10** Functions with Outputs

So today was interesting; and more comfortable than previous days. I gave myself a day off this weekend because it's what made sense. I get that coding 100 days in a row will create a habit; but I certainly don't think that taking a day off will ruin this. I decided to commit to this and I'm following through at a pace I can.

In lieu of doing the full class, I simply did a bit of time on the "SoloLearn" application to learn python; it felt more relaxing and I feel like I would greatly gain from varying sources of knowledge.

In any case! We made a calculator today (big wow!). The project was obviously simple enough and we needed to access a created dictionary to print a particular symbol that would trigger a specific function. The idea here was really to understand "outputs" and reusing them; e.g. using the answer to the previous equation for a following equation.

Tomorrow we're set to do the first "capstone" project; which should call to all the material I've learned over the past 10 days. I'm a little uncertain on how it'll go... I know I've been doing well enough; but there also seems to be key principles that I'm missing out on. The project itself is BlackJack; and depending on how it goes, I might just go back to Day 1 and revise everything to make sure it's well sunken in.

In any case, should be fun!
