# learning-python-100daysofcode
Here's the projects I've been making in the #100daysofcode challenge! I'm taking the class taught by Dr. Angela on Udemy

On Day 1, we did a simple band name generator that concatenated the input of user's "City" and "Pet Animal" into a _Band Name_ lol
  It was pretty fun, learned the simple idea behind getting "input" and "printing" things to the terminal. I unfortunately didn't think to save the file itself but the concept     behind it was simple enough that I shouldn't have to worry about reproducing it.
  
**Day 2**
Learning is getting me nice and motivated! Today the ending challenge was to compose a tip calculator which would take into account the following variables"
- How much did the total bill come up to
- How much (%) tip do you want to give
- How many people are splitting the total bill

I uploaded the file as tip-calculator.py on my github profile (and am writing this!) in hopes of getting more comfortable with the community's tools. Check out the line of code for the tip calculator should you wish to use it for yourself :D <3
