# learning-python-100daysofcode
Here's the projects I've been making in the #100daysofcode challenge! I'm taking the class taught by Dr. Angela on Udemy

**Day 1**
we did a simple band name generator that concatenated the input of user's "City" and "Pet Animal" into a _Band Name_ lol (e.g. Montreal Dogs)
It was pretty fun, learned the simple idea behind getting "input" and "printing" things to the terminal. I unfortunately didn't think to save the file itself but the concept     behind it was simple enough that I shouldn't have to worry about reproducing it.

**Day 2**
Learning is getting me nice and motivated! Today the ending challenge was to compose a tip calculator which would take into account the following variables"
- How much did the total bill come up to
- How much (%) tip do you want to give
- How many people are splitting the total bill

I uploaded the file as tip-calculator.py on my github profile (and am writing this!) in hopes of getting more comfortable with the community's tools. Check out the line of code for the tip calculator should you wish to use it for yourself :D <3 It's obviously far from perfect but it's a start to real world application that I'm excited for.

**Day 3**
The day didn't go as well (coding wise) as I would've liked. The class took me much longer than I had anticipated; But I pushed through on every single item and found the answer myself without looking through the teacher's solution. THAT BEING SAID! The reason it didn't go as well as I would've like is because it was a Saturday, and also the birthday of my sister in-law; And since my fiancee's parents are leaving for the winter, and her birthday is in December, we also celebrated her.

We went to a wonderful Italian place called Cafe Il Cortile in Montreal. I had never been to a proper Italian place before and truly enjoyed every minute of the almost 4 hours we sat there chatting and eating. Life in Italy looks pretty darn swell and we left feeling full, recharged and socially high. Coming home after that was wonderful although we now had quite a few tasks to go over (dinner and walking the dogs amongst others). I ended up starting the class around 6PM and stopped before the Day's final project around 10:30PM - Brain was fried and I thought it would be better to pause, recharge and come back at it in the morning.

**Day 4**
On the morning of day 4, I was motivated anew! Ready to tackle on the previous day's project as well as completing the Day 4 curriculum. I completed the Day 3 project, a simple "Choose your own adventure" kind of game (there were only 3 steps though so nothing intricate). It made for a good refresher on what I had tried to cram into my fried brain yesterday; I was able to use all the if/elif/else statements correctly, my final code didn't return any errors and I felt delighted to move onto the next thing!

as far as the remainder of the day went; I once again felt quite challenged. The day's subject was **radomisation** - I learned to "import random" and to use a few different functions from it, the end of the day project consisted in a "Rock Paper Scissors" project which I struggled with. I was able to come up with a solution, but after watching the teacher's example, I realized how inelegant and overly mapped my code was. I was still able to get a successful result, but it did feel as though I missed out on some key concepts; or at least misunderstood them.

My confidence isn't shaken though! Feeling stupid (although stupid might be a bit harsh; maybe just less apt?) is part of learning; and I know that as I progress, some things will come to naturally make more sense. And should anything require revision, I'll definitely go back through the modules to better grasp their concepts. I'll see how Day 5 goes, based on that, I might go back to day 4 for a complete redo and resume from there.

**Day 5**
Today I'm learning about Python Loops! The end of the day project will be a random password generator - which is pretty neat! I use some every now and then for more secure PWs, so having one I can use of my own will be pretty sweet!

Ok so today was THE BEST DAY - The theme of the day was "Loops", pretty much only around the "for" function and the "range" funtion. The day's exercises all went very well; and I was able to grasp the concepts much better than yesterday. Not only that, but at the end of the day's curriculum, the teacher also explained how "feeling inadequate" in everything so far is still ok; there's a lot of concepts that will simply become clearer with time as long as I STICK TO IT YO! **_And I intend to_**.

The first exercise was simple enough and was a practice in using the basic "for" function. The objective was to calculate the average weight of a group of students; And although there are more direct functions to do so, the idea behind the practise was to understand the core logic of how loops work. I started by creating a variable for totalHeight and a variable for numberofParticipants and set them to 0; and for every 'student' in 'student_heights'(input requested), totalHeight += student; and for the participants, the loops was: for number in student_heights (previous input) numberofParticipants += 1.

This way, after getting all weight inputs, the system adds them up and counts (by +1) how many 'times' a weight was entered. To obtain the final result, I decided to store it in a variable called avgHeight = round(totalHeight / numberofParticipants) and then simply printed that variable! I used the round function to round to the nearest integer instead of giving decimals.

Now I'm all excited for tomorrow! Very happy with something though:
- Yesterday, I was on Day 4 of 100; and 100/4=25 so I was 1/25th of the way through
- Today, on Day 5 of 100; 100/5=20 so, I'm now 1/20th of the way done!
Repeating this 5 days only 19 more times will be an absolute treat! Can't wait :D
